# KineFlux: Accurate prediction of flux distributions compatible with metabolite concentration effects in genome-scale metabolic networks

This repository contains the code and data for the Kineflux approach. The `code/` folder includes all the necessary steps for: 
- Preprocessing the data
- Training machine learning models
- Solving quadratic programming (QP) problems,
- Analyzing results,
across different datasets, e.g., [Davadi et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1514240113), [Heckmann et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2001562117), and [Chen et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2108391118))


Note: To solve the optimization problems, please ensure that the [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) is installed and properly configured on your system.
